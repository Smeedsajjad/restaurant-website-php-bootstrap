# Restaurant Website - PHP, Bootstrap, jQuery, and OOP

This is a fully functional and responsive restaurant website built using PHP (with OOP), Bootstrap, jQuery, and Ajax. The website includes key features like displaying the restaurant's menu, location, contact form, and other essential information. It is designed to be mobile-friendly and works seamlessly across different devices.

## Features

- **Home Page**: Welcome message, restaurant overview, and featured items.
- **Menu Page**: Display of restaurant menu items using dynamic content from PHP.
- **Contact Page**: Contact form with Ajax functionality to submit form data without reloading the page.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout, built with Bootstrap.
- **Smooth User Interaction**: JavaScript and jQuery for dynamic content and interactivity.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**:
  - HTML5: Structure of the website.
  - CSS3: Custom styling for the website.
  - JavaScript: Client-side functionality and interactivity.
  - Bootstrap: Responsive layout and components.
  - jQuery: Simplified DOM manipulation and Ajax calls.
  - Ajax: For asynchronous form submissions and data fetching.
  
- **Backend**:
  - PHP: Server-side scripting.
  - OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) in PHP: To handle website logic in a modular and maintainable way.
  - MySQL (optional): For storing data (e.g., menu items, contact form submissions).

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SmeedSajjad/restaurant-website-php-bootstrap.git
   ```

2. **Set up the environment**:
   - Make sure you have PHP, MySQL, and a web server (like Apache) installed on your local machine or server.
   - If using MySQL, create a database and set up your connection in the `config.php` file.

3. **Run the website**:
   - Place the project files in your web server's root directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP).
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost/restaurant-website-php-bootstrap`.

```

## Configuration

- **config.php**: Configure your MySQL database connection here (if applicable).

```php
<?php
define('DB_SERVER', 'localhost');
define('DB_USERNAME', 'your-username');
define('DB_PASSWORD', 'your-password');
define('DB_DATABASE', 'your-database');

// Create database connection
$conn = new mysqli(DB_SERVER, DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD, DB_DATABASE);

// Check connection
if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}
?>
```

- **Menu Handling (OOP)**: PHP is used to fetch and display the restaurant menu. The menu items are retrieved from a database (if applicable) using OOP.

```php
class Menu {
    private $conn;

    public function __construct($db_conn) {
        $this->conn = $db_conn;
    }

    public function getMenuItems() {
        $sql = "SELECT * FROM menu_items";
        $result = $this->conn->query($sql);
        return $result;
    }
}
```
